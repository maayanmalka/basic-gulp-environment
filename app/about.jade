                p We then encourage the kids to create something new all by themselvs. They are set off on their own advantures, to explore the limits of what theyâ€™ve learned and be involved in the creation.

              | It's a game of balance. Technology is taking such a big part of our lives and we feel it's important to get kids 
              strong in and out 
              | of the digital world. That's why all our activities are printables. While practicing their crafting skills, we encourage kids to share their creations to the community, get feedback and learn they can affect the world from a very young age.

              strong Creativity
              |  is a Responsibility
            p We are a small group of artists and educators, we strongly believe creativity cannot be tought - every child is born with it, But it can be suppressed if we don't protect and nurture it. 
            br
            p We hope our Catbears can provide this environment for children all over the world and help them develop their creative minds.
